    "1. What is the ratio of non-fraud transactions to fraud transactions? \n",
    "2. What is the average number of trans. per client?\n",
    "3. What are the counts for different transactions types for fraud transactions? Use histogram. \n",

    "\n",
    "These questions will give us insights into the data that can help with preprocessing data, feature engineering, model choice, and model evaluation. For example. we know that the data is severely unbalanced because the number of transactions that are fraud is 0.3% of the dataset (approx. 18000). Thus, we will explore different training techniques such as under-sampling so we can have an equal number of positive and negative cases. In addition, we also know that all the fraud transactions were one of two types: Cash-Out and Purchase. Thus we might explore how filtering incoming transactions can increase prediction accuracy.  "
