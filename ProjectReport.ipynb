    "##### Dataset description:\n",
    "* The dataset is generated by simulator called PaySim.\n",
    "* PaySim simulator:\n",
    "    * Generates a synthetic dataset from aggregated private dataset to resemble normal transaction behavior\n",
    "    * Combination of statistical and social network analysis\n",
    "    * Malicious transactions are later injected to the synthetic dataset\n",
    "    * The dataset contains 6,372,620 transactions simulated to resemble a month of data\n",
    "    * Each transaction is described using 10 featues\n",

    "##### Attributes description:\n",
    "* CASH-IN - Process of increasing the amount available for purchases (e.g. paying your credit card bill)\n",
    "* CASH-OUT - Opposite of CASH-IN, it means to withdraw cash which decreases the amount available\n",
    "* DEBIT - Is similar process to CASH-OUT and involves sending the money to other account (e.g. preauthorized debit)\n",
    "* BILL-PAYMENT - Paying online bills (e.g. hydro)\n",
    "* PURCHASE - Process of sending money to another user for goods or services\n",
    "* Time_Stamp - Transactions recorded on hourly basis (~31 days of simulation)\n",
    "* Transaction_Type - CASH-IN, CASH-OUT, DEBIT, BILL-PAYMENT and PURCHASE \n",
    "* Amount - Amount of transaction in local currency\n",
    "* Client_Id - ID of the client who initiated the transaction (credit card holder)\n",
    "* Client_Old_Balance - Balance before transaction\n",
    "* Cleint_New_Balance - Balance after transaction\n",
    "* Merchant_Id - ID of the merchant\n",
    "* Merchant_Old -_Balance - Balance before transaction\n",
    "* Merchant_New_Balance - Balance after transaction\n",
    "* Is_Fraud - Fraudulent transaction flag (target variable)\n",
    "* Is_Flagged_Fraud - Any transaction amount  > 200,000\n"

    "###  Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Feature Engineering \n",
    "1. Transform Transaction_Type column into a one-hot encoding using Pandas get_dummies() function.\n",
    "2. Remove these columns: 'Time_Stamp', 'Merchant_Id', 'Merchant_Old_Balance', 'Merchant_New_Balance', 'Is_Flagged_Fraud'. \n",
    "3. Create feature '%_of_balance' by performing transaction-wise division: Amount/Client_Old_Balance.  \n",
    "4. Combine Client_Old_Balance and Client_New_Balance into one feature by taking the difference in values. Remove Client_Old_Balance and Client_New_Balance Columns. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Preprocessing\n",
    "1. Standardize all numerical columns by subtracting each value in a column from the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Undersample Majority Class\n",
    "1. Find indices for non-fraud transactions and indices for fraud transactions. \n",
    "2. Randomly select n non-fraud indices where n equals number of fraud transactions. \n",
    "3. Concatenate non-fraud indices and fraud indices and select those transactions as your new dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model Training\n",
    "1. Split the dataset into a training and test set using an 80/20 split. \n",
    "2. Train the follow models on the training set, using cross-validation for selection of hyper parameters when appropriate: \n",
    "    * Logistic Regression\n",
    "    * SVM with RBF kernel\n",
    "    * Random forest \n",
    "    * K Nearest Neighbours\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model Evaluation \n",
    "Calculate the following for each of the models above: \n",
    "* Accuracy\n",
    "* AUC score\n",
    "* F1 score\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model Interpretation\n",
